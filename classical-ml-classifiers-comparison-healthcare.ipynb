Analyze Bias-Variance Behavior**\n","When comparing the base Decision Tree to the ensemble models, a clear shift in the bias-variance tradeoff is visible. The single Decision Tree achieved ann  accuracy of ~92.4% and a recall of ~93.4%. However, ensemble methods like Random Forest and Bagging both improved performance, jumping to ~94.7% accuracy and ~97.2% recall. This indicates that the single Decision Tree likely suffered from high variance (overfitting the training data). By bootstrapping the data and aggregating the results of multiple trees, the Bagging and Random Forest classifiers successfully reduced that variance, leading to a model that generalizes much better on unseen test data.\n","\n","**2. Comparing L1 vs L2 Regularization Effects**\n","When evaluating the Logistic Regression models, L2 regularization (Ridge) outperformed L1 regularization (Lasso). The L2 model achieved an accuracy of ~98.8% and a recall of ~99.0%, perfectly matching the unpenalized Logistic Regression model. In contrast, the L1 model's accuracy dropped slightly to ~97.0%. Because L1 regularization applies an absolute value penalty that pushes leess important feature weights to exactly zero (performing aggressive feature selection), it likely discarded some minor but useful information among the 30 numerical features. L2 regularization, which squre the weights and shrinks them without eliminating them entirely, proved much more effective for capturing the undrlying patterns in this specific medical dataset.\n","\n","**3. Recommending the Best Model with Proper Reasoning**\n","For this project, the primary objective is medical risk prediction. In a healthcare context, the cost of a False Negative (predicting a patient is 'Benign' when they actually have a 'Malignant' high-risk condition) is catastrophic. Therefore, while *Accuracy* is important, *Recall* is the most critical evaluation metric.\n","\n","Based onn the results, I recommend the *Logistic Regression (with L2 Regularization)* as the optimal model. It provides an exceptional balance, delivering the highest overall accuracy (~98.8%) while maintaining a stellar recall of ~99.0%.\n","\n","On the other hand, if the strict medical requirement is to have absolutely zero False Negatives, the *K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)* model could be considered, as it achieved a perfect Recall of 1.0 (100%), though it sacrifices a small amount of overall accuracy (~95.9%) to achieve this.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"KHdjw8H4PFL1"}}]}
